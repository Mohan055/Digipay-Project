Description: 
-Digipayment are transactions that take place via digital or online modes, with no physical exchange of money involved. This means that both parties, the payer and the payee, use electronic 
mediums to exchange money.

The Government of India has been undertaking several measures to promote and encourage digital payments in the country. As part of the ‘Digital India’ campaign, the government has an aim to create a ‘digitally empowered’ economy that is ‘Faceless, Paperless, Cashless’. There are various types and methods of digital payments.

Please note that digipayment can take place on the internet as well as on physical premises. For example, if you buy something from Amazon and pay for it via UPI, it qualifies as a digital payment. Similarly, if you purchase something from your local Kirana store and choose to pay via UPI instead of handing over cash, that also is a digital payment.
