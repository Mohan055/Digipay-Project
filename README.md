   Description: 

In today's digital world, transactions conducted through digital or online means without the physical exchange of money are known as digipayments. This method involves both the payer and the payee utilizing electronic mediums to exchange funds securely.
The Government of India has implemented numerous initiatives to promote and foster digital payments as part of the 'Digital India' campaign. The objective is to establish a 'digitally empowered' economy that is 'Faceless, Paperless, Cashless.' Various types and methods of digital payments exist, encompassing both online transactions and those carried out in physical locations.
For instance, making a purchase on Amazon and paying via UPI qualifies as a digital payment, just as opting to pay for items at a local Kirana store using UPI instead of cash does.
